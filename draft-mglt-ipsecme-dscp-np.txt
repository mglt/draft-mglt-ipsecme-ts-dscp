Internet-Draft             DSCP Notify Payload                March 2025


2.  Introduction

   In the ESP Header Compression Profile Diet-ESP
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-diet-esp], two communicating peers can reach an
   agreement on DSCP values as part of a compression context.  Within
   this context, DSCP values serve not only as classifiers but are also
   compressed by the sending peer and subsequently decompressed by the
   receiving peer for both incoming and outgoing traffic.  This process
   necessitates a mutual agreement on DSCP values for a specific pair of
   Security Associations (SAs).  The DSCP Notification Payload outlined
   in this specification facilitates the negotiation of these DSCP
   values for a pair of SAs during the CREATE_CHILD_SA Exchange.

   Furthermore, the explicit negotiation of DSCP values enhances the
   "classifier" mechanism, allowing for the establishment of this
   mechanism and the agreement on various clusters of DSCP values to be
   considered for each pair of SAs.  [RFC4301], Section 4.1 recognizes
   that aggregating traffic with multiple DSCP values over a single SA
   may lead to the inappropriate discarding of lower-priority packets
   due to the windowing mechanism employed by this feature.  To mitigate
   this issue, [RFC4301], Section 4.1 advises that the sender implement
   a "classifier" mechanism to distribute traffic across multiple SAs.
   While [RFC4301], Section 4.4.2.1 refers to the "DSCP values" fields
   in the Security Association Database (SAD), [RFC7296] does not
   provide a way for peers to indicate which classification is ongoing
   nor which "DSCP values" are linked to the created SA.  This document
   addresses that deficiency by specifying the DSCP Notification
   Payload, which explicitly identifies the DSCP code points that will
   be tunneled in the newly established tunnel during a CREATE_CHILD_SA
   Exchange.

   It is essential to recognize that in a standard "classifier" context,
   there is no necessity for the same cluster of DSCP values to be
   linked to both the inbound and outbound Security Associations (SAs)
   of a specific pair.  Typically, one peer may employ one pair of SAs,
   while the other peer may choose a different pair.  This flexibility
   arises because DSCP values are applied exclusively by the sending
   node, rather than the receiving node.  Although the use of the DSCP
   Notification Payload does not inhibit such configurations, it is
   likely to diminish their occurrence.  Conversely, we anticipate that
   the explicit negotiation of DSCP values and pairs of SAs will
   facilitate the management of these "classifiers."

   *  DSCP values -- the set of DSCP values allowed for packets carried
      over this SA.  If no values are specified, no DSCP-specific
      filtering is applied.  If one or more values are specified, these
      are used to select one SA among several that match the traffic
      selectors for an outbound packet.  Note that these values are NOT
      checked against inbound traffic arriving on the SA.

   The text does not clearly specify what happens when the DSCP of a
   packet does not match any of the corresponding DSCP values.  This
   document proposes the following text:

   *  DSCP values -- the set of DSCP values allowed for packets carried
      over this SA.  If no values are specified, no DSCP-specific
      filtering is applied.  If one or more values are specified, these
      are used to select one SA among several that match the traffic
      selectors for an outbound packet.  In case of multiple matches a
      preference to the most selective list DSCP value could be
      implemented by the peer's policy.  If the DSCP value of the packet
      does not match any of the DSCP values provided by the associated
      matching SAs and there is at least one SA with no DSCP-specific
      filtering, then, one of these SA SHOULD be selected.  On the other
      hand, if all SAs have DSCP filtering, then, any of the matching
      SAs can be selected.  Note that these values MUST NOT be checked
      against inbound traffic arriving on the SA.

4.  Protocol Overview

   The illustrative example of this section considers the following use
   case:

   *  Expedited Forwarding (EF) with low latency traffic has its own
      IPsec tunnel,

   *  Assured Forward (AF) classes with different drop precedence (which
      may take a different route) have their own tunnel,

   *  and all remaining DSCP values are put into a third tunnel.

Internet-Draft             DSCP Notify Payload                March 2025


   This section details how a peer uses the DSCP Notify Payload to
   classify traffic carrying the DSCP values AF11 or AF3 in one tunnel,
   traffic carrying a DSCP value of EF in another tunnel, and traffic
   with other DSCP values in a third tunnel.  The third SA is designated
   as the default no-DSCP specific SA.  It is RECOMMENDED to configure
   the Security Policy Data Base (SPD), so that such a default no-DSCP
   specific SA is created and it is RECOMMENDED its creation happens
   prior to the SA with specific DSCP values.  Note that according to
   Section 3, there is no specific ordering, but starting with the no-
   DSCP specific SA ensures compatibility with an IPsec implementation
   that would for example discard or create a new SA when the DSCP does
   not match.

   Generally, it is recommended that the outer DSCP value matches the
   inner DSCP value so that the tunneled packet be treated similarly to
   the inner packet.  Such behavior is provided by setting the Bypass
   DSCP to True.  If the initiator prefers for example every tunneled
   packet being treated similarly, then, an explicit mapping needs to be
   indicated.  Typically, the initiator may be willing to prevent
   reordered traffic to fall outside the anti-replay windows.  Note that
   such policy is implemented by each peer.

      Initiator                         Responder
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,]
          [IDr,] AUTH, SAi2,
          TSi, TSr}  -->

                                   <--  HDR, SK {IDr, [CERT,] AUTH,
                                            SAr2, TSi, TSr}

   Once the no-DSCP specific SA is created, all traffic with any DSCP
   value is steered to that SA.  The initiator then creates the child SA
   associated with specific DSCP values.  In this example, it creates
   the SA associated with the DSCP value AF11 or AF3, followed by the
   one associated with value of EF, but this does not follow any
   specific ordering.  The initiator specifies the DSCP values being
   classified in that SA with a DSCP Notify Payload that carries the
   DSCP values.

   If the responder supports the DSCP Notify Payload, it SHOULD respond
   with a Notify Payload that indicates the DSCP values selected for
   that tunnel.  By default these values SHOULD be the ones specified by
   the initiator, but the responder's policy MAY select other values.
   If the responder does not want to perform DSCP filtering, the
   responder SHOULD send an empty DSCP Notify Payload, in order to at
   least indicate support for the DSCP Notify Payload.

Internet-Draft             DSCP Notify Payload                March 2025


   As specified in [RFC7296], Section 3.10.1, a Notify Payload with
   status type MUST be ignored if it is not recognized.  The absence of
   a DSCP Notify Payload by the responder may be due to the responder
   not supporting the notification, or not advertising the application
   of DSCP filtering.  We do not consider that the absence of
   classification by the responder prevents the SA from being created.
   The classification is at least performed for the outbound stream,
   which is sufficient to justify the creation of the additional SA.
   Note also that DSCP values are not agreed, and the responder cannot
   for example narrow down the list of DSCP values being classified.  If
   that would cause a significant issue, the responder can create
   another SA with the narrowed-down list of DSCP values.  The responder
   may also REKEY_SA the previous SA to redefine the DSCP values to be
   considered.

   When multiple DSCP values are indicated, and the initiator is mapping
   the outer DSCP value, the outer DSCP value is expected to be one of
   these values.

      Initiator                         Responder
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      HDR, SK {SA, Ni, KEi, N(DSCP, AF11, AF3)} -->

                                   <--  HDR, SK {SA, Nr, KEr,
                                             N(DSCP, AF11, AF3)}

   The initiator may then create additional child SAs specifying other
   DSCP values.

      Initiator                         Responder
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      HDR, SK {SA, Ni, KEi, N(DSCP, EE)} -->

5.  Protocol Description

   During the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, the initiator or the responder
   MAY indicate to the other peer the DSCP filtering policy applied to
   the SA.  This is done via the DSCP Notify Payload indicating the DSCP
   values being considered for that SA.

   The initiator MAY send an empty DSCP Notify Payload to indicate
   support of the DSCP Notify Payload as well as an indication the
   negotiated SA as a no-DSCP specific SA.  This SA MAY be followed by
   the creation of the DSCP-specific SA.

   Upon receiving a DSCP Notify Payload, if the responder supports the
   notification it SHOULD respond with a DSCP Notify Payload.  The value
   indicated SHOULD be the one selected by the initiator.

   There is no specific error handling.

6.  Payload Description

   The DSCP Notify Payload is based on the format of the Notify Payload
   as described in [RFC7296], Section 3.10 and represented in Figure 1.

                          Figure 1: Notify Payload

   The fields Next Payload, Critical Bit, RESERVED, and Payload Length
   are defined in [RFC7296].  Specific fields defined in this document
   are:

   *  Protocol ID (1 octet): Set to zero.

   *  Security Parameter Index (SPI) Size (1 octet): Set to zero.

   *  Notify Message Type (2 octets): Specifies the type of notification
      message.  It is set to DSCP_VALUES (see Section 7).

   *  Notification Data (variable length): lists the DSCP values that
      are considered for the SA.  Each value is encoded over a single
      byte.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate one value in the "IKEv2 Notify Message
   Types - Status Types" registry: (available at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/ikev2-parameters/
   ikev2-parameters.xhtml#ikev2-parameters-16) with the following
   definition:

     Value    Notify Messages - Status Types
   -----------------------------------------
     TBD      DSCP

8.  Security Considerations

   As the DSCP value field is already defined by [RFC4301] in the SA
   structure, the security considerations of [RFC4301] apply.  The DSCP
   Notification Payload communicates clearly the DSCP value field to the
   responder.

   When the tunnel mode is used, the communication of the DSCP value
   field could be easily interpreted by monitoring the received DSCP
   values of the inner traffic when that traffic is encapsulated, and so
   no secret information is revealed.  When the transport mode is used,
   that value may be changed by the network and eventually, the value of
   the field could be unknown to the other peer.  However, this cannot
   be considered as a protection mechanism, and the communication of the
   DSCP value cannot be considered as revealing information that was
   previously not revealed.

   The notification of the set of DSCP values to the other peer does not
   require additional resources either for the initiator or for the
   receiver.  The SA is created either with DSCP values or without.

   Similarly, the notification of the set of DSCP values to the other
   peer does not introduce additional constraints on the traffic.
   First, the responder may also ignore the DSCP Notification Payload.
   Then, when an SA is associated with a set of DSCP values, this does
   not prevent the other peer from sending traffic with a different DSCP
   value over that SA.  In other words, traffic coming with unexpected
   DSCP values is not rejected as would have been the case if the DSCP
   values had been considered as Traffic Selectors.
